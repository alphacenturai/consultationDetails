`“Healing may not be so much about getting better, it's about letting go of everything that isn't you – all of the expectations, all of the beliefs – and becoming who you are. ~ Rachel Naomi Remen`

## Introduction

In this modern world it is impossible to keep yourself away from all the external stresses (physical, mental, emotional, environmental etc.).
But one can definitely improve the healing power of her body and protect against these stresses.

## Let's see how

### Mindfulness

- Mindfulness is a practice of consciously focusing your attention on the present moment and accepting it without any judgment.
- Studies have proven that mindfulness can bring improvement in both physical and mental health.
- It can also bring positive changes in attitude and behavior.
- Once you learn this art of being in the present moment you will learn to notice and accept your emotions without judgment.
- This will further result in less stress, improved physical, mental as well as emotional well-being.
- Easiest way to practice is through **mindful drinking**.
Whenever you drink water or any other liquid, sit down properly,take small sips, feel every sip; focus on taste, smell, colour, texture, coolness of that liquid.Once you grasp this concept it is very easy to use it with almost any other routine activity.

### Meditation

- It is a deeper level of mindfulness with a higher purpose.
- It is a practice where an individual uses a technique – such as mindfulness or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity.
- The purpose of meditation is to train attention and awareness and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm - stable state.
- It has a healing effect on the body; it can be used as a therapeutic technique.
