## Hi, **Welcome to Naarya!**

I am **Dr. Niyati**, a Gynecologist by profession.

I have been observing women's lives and their problems for quite a long time.
Initially I used to wonder,
Why women are so careless about their health?
Why don't they seek medical help in the initial stage of their problems?
Why can't they follow simple preventive measures to have a better health?

**But once I started my family, I realised that it is easier said than done.**

For most of us everyday life is a never-ending battle with time - managing work - household chores and family and children needs.
And from here came the idea of creating a simple, quick and easy to use digital platform for women that can help reduce their day to day stress and  improve every aspect of their health.

Most of us wrongly consider health as physical one only but in reality it is the manifestation of Emotional, Mental and Psychological health. Specially for women because we have to face all kind of stress in our lives, So if we could address every aspect of our health simultaneously, we can enjoy a happy and healthy life that we all deserve.

And this is the purpose behind creating **Naarya**, to give you holistic health care in the easiest possible way.

Here our experts are just one click away for any guidance and help.

_All you need to do is start taking charge of your health and consciously make efforts for its betterment._

Wishing you a healthier and happier life ahead with **Naarya!**
