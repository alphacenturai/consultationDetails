`"Awareness Is Power."`

## Introduction

Whenever there is any breast related issue, the first question that comes to our mind is whom should I Consult? Gynecologist? And the answer is NO! You should consult Breast Surgeons who are specialised in dealing with all breast related problems, including cancer. Not all breast lesions are cancer but it needs proper evaluation by experts to rule it out.
We don't know the exact cause of breast cancer so we can't prevent it completely, But breastfeeding, a balanced diet, regular physical activity and lifestyle modifications can reduce your cancer risk. Good news is that it is almost completely curable if diagnosed at an early stage and this is only possible through regular self breast examination and routine mammography. Lets see how:

### Self breast examination

Also known as self breast awareness. It is examination of your own breast regularly through a particular method, so that you know your breast very well and any change or even a small lump can be picked up early.
It should be done on a fixed day (between 7 to 10th day) of your periods every month. Please use the reminder facility provided on the App. But only self breast examination is not sufficient; An yearly examination by your Breast Surgeon is certainly recommended.

### Mammography

- Women aged 40-44 can have once a year mammography
- Women aged 45-54 should have once a year mammography
- Women aged 55 and above should have once in 2 year mammography

Few types of breast cancers are genetic so if there is a history of breast cancer in your maternal family (Grandmother, Mother, Sister, Maternal aunt) you should consult a breast surgeon as earlier mammography is recommended in those cases.

## Warning signs of cancer

Cancers are deadly because mostly they are diagnosed at a very late stage.This happens either due to ignoring the symptoms or not being evaluated by an expert. Here are some common symptoms which may indicate cancer and should not be ignored:
