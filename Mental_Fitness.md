`"The strength of your mind determines the quality of your life.`

## Introduction

Mental health is the most neglected self care routine especially in women. There are studies that show that indian women are the most stressed among the world. As women, we often tend to take a lot of responsibilities.Managing between job and family,applying additional pressure to do all with great skill,precision and love, results in chronic stress which is a major contributing factor in rapid ageing, cancer, heart disease, menstrual irregularities, anxiety and depression.

**Wondering what should be your mental health regime?**

Here are a few ideas for you to consider and implement:

1. First and foremost thing is - Share Your Burden! Distribute responsibilities with other family members. Everyone is equally responsible for a happy and peaceful home.
2. Avoid being Perfect -there is absolutely no need for you to be perfect and best in each and every chore. It is practically impossible! So don't chase that.
3. Learn to say **NO**. Very important to shield yourself from undue requests.
4. Just take out a few seconds between your hectic shcedule,sit and take 10 deep breaths,and see the spontaneous calming effect!
5. Understand that being beautiful is your right not a duty so don't take pressure of always being presentable.
6. Eat healthy, sleep well and do moderate exercise everyday.
7. Make a schedule and give time to yourself. You matter!
8. Go for an outing. Make time compulsorily.
9. Pursue your hobbies; it is a very good stress buster.
