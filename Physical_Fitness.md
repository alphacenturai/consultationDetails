## Introduction

Regular physical activity keeps you both physically and mentally fit. It could be a simple walk, Yoga or a workout at the gym. Studies have proven that regular physical activity can prevent almost all chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease and even Cancer. Daily Moderate Exercise helps maintain our energy levels throughout the day, which is very much required for today's modern woman who has to juggle with all her responsibilities. It also increases happy hormones that help prevent anxiety and depression, which are quite common these days.

## Walking

It is the easiest exercise. One should have a brisk walk at least for 15-30 mins everyday. Brisk walk should be done on an empty stomach preferably in the morning. After meals one can do just 100 steps of slow-walk which helps in better digestion of food.

**Caution** : brisk walk after a meal can result in indigestion and bloating. So only slow walks are advised.

## Yoga

It is a blend of physical movements and breathing techniques. It brings physical ,mental, hormonal and emotional harmony to the body and thus prevents us from many diseases. Most gynecological problems are due to hormonal imbalance like irregular periods, PCOS, Fertility issues, Perimenopausal problems including mood swings etc. Yoga thus has a preventive as well as therapeutic role in all.
