`"Communities and countries and ultimately the world are only as strong as the health of their women."`

## Introduction

More responsibility and less time, this is the problem with almost every woman in the present world and that results in ignorance of our health problems. We bring you this digital platform where you can discuss your problems through Whatsapp messaging and depending upon the issue we shall arrange online or in person consultation.

Whenever you consult your gynec for any problem, you should also discuss PAP's smear and vaccination against cervical cancer.

### Let's see why

For most cancers, we don't know the exact cause till date. Studies show that balanced diet, regular physical activity and lifestyle changes can reduce your cancer risk substantially.

Cervical cancer is caused by a virus called HPV and that's why we can prevent this cancer almost completely by vaccination. It can even be detected in a precancerous stage by easy testing (HPV, PAP's smear). Treatment of this precancerous stage is much simpler than that of cancer itself.

In Spite of having such simple preventive measures, we are still facing a high number of cervical cancer cases and that too in an advanced stage. The reason is lack of awareness. So make yourself aware and take charge of your health, now!
