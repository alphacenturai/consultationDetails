## Introduction

To live in this patriarchal society with dignity, respect, gender equality, and justice, is still a difficult task for women. The government has given many rights and made several laws for women but most of us are unaware of those and continue to accept this injustice at the home, workplace and in society.

Here are few rights that every woman should know -

1. Right to draw an equal salary for same work as compared to men
2. Right against workplace harassment
3. Right against domestic violence which includes verbal, economical, emotional, and sexual violence
4. Right against indecent representation
5. Right against being stalked
6. Right to Zero FIR - An FIR can be filed at any police station irrespective of the location where the incident occurred or a specific jurisdiction it comes under. The Zero FIR can later be moved to the police station in whose jurisdiction the case falls.
7. Right to register a virtual complaint - a woman can file a complaint via email, or writing her complaint and sending it to a police station from the registered postal address
8. Right to get free legal aid
9. Right to dignity and decency - any medical examination procedure on a woman must be performed by - or in the presence of another woman
10. Female sexual assault victims have a right to keep their identity anonymous
11. Right to not get arrested at night
12. NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR WOMEN ACT:
    - This is the most powerful act, the national commission for women (NCW) is the statutory government body that is regulated by law.
    - It represents the rights of women in India. It provides a voice for their issues and concerns.
    - The complaint and investigation cell of the commission processes all the complaints related to domestic violence, harassment, dowry, torture, desertion, bigamy, rape, refusal to register FIR, cruelty by husband, deprivation, gender discrimination, and sexual harassment at the workplace.
