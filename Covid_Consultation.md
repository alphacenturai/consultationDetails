## Introduction

Early diagnosis, intense monitoring, appropriate and timely treatment, is the only way to defeat covid. For early diagnosis everyone needs to understand its symptoms which could be anything as mentioned below. Recognize and accept them and seek timely medical help. Denial will only increase the chances of complications and risks.

## Symptoms

- Cold, no matter how mild it is
- Cough
- Fever, even low grade
- Weakness, even if it is the only symptoms
- Bodyache, Headache
- Diarrhea (even only 1-2 episodes)
- Vomiting (especially in children)

The moment you notice these symptoms, isolate yourself so that other members don't get infected. Counting of days should be done from the very first day of your first symptom. Consult the expert, start treatment and monitoring. Remember "monitoring" is crucial!

## Written records of below vitals will prove useful

- Fever - Timings and grade and day of illness. Persisting high grade fever after 6 days of illness is a sign of complication.
- Pulse rate - shown in your pulse oximeter or you can count manually for 1 min.
- Respiratory Rate - This is the most crucial vital. It is the number of times your chest moves during 1 min of breathing. If it is more than 22, immediately contact your Doctor.
- SPO2 - This is oxygen saturation of your blood. It should not fall below 94%. Even with normal saturation if the respiratory rate goes greater than 22, one needs to consult the Doctor.
